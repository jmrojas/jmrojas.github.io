  abstract  = "A common application of search-based software testing
               is to generate test cases for all goals defined by a
               coverage criterion (e.g., lines, branches,
               mutants). Rather than generating one test case at a
               time for each of these goals individually, whole test
               suite generation optimizes entire test suites towards
               satisfying all goals at the same time. There is
               evidence that the overall coverage achieved with this
               approach is superior to that of targeting individual
               coverage goals. Nevertheless, there remains some
               uncertainty on (a) whether the results generalize
               beyond branch coverage, (b) whether the whole test
               suite approach might be inferior to a more focused
               search for some particular coverage goals, and (c)
               whether generating whole test suites could be optimized
               by only targeting coverage goals not already
               covered. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis
               to study these questions. An empirical study on 100
               Java classes using three different coverage criteria
               reveals that indeed there are some testing goals that
               are only covered by the traditional approach, although
               their number is only very small in comparison with
               those which are exclusively covered by the whole test
               suite approach. We find that keeping an archive of
               already covered goals along with the tests covering
               them and focusing the search on uncovered goals
               overcomes this small drawback on larger classes,
               leading to an improved overall effectiveness of whole
               test suite generation.",

  abstract  = {One of the main challenges to software testing today is
                  to efficiently handle heap-manipulating
                  programs. These programs often build complex,
                  dynamically allocated data structures during
                  execution and, to ensure reliability, the testing
                  process needs to consider all possible shapes these
                  data structures can take.  This creates scalability
                  issues since high (often exponential) numbers of
                  shapes may be built due to the \emph{aliasing} of
                  references. This paper presents a novel \emph{CLP
                  heap solver} for the test case generation of
                  heap-manipulating programs that is more scalable
                  than previous proposals, thanks to the treatment of
                  reference aliasing by means of \emph{disjunction},
                  and to the use of advanced \emph{back-propagation}
                  of heap related constraints.  In addition, the heap
                  solver supports the use of \emph{heap assumptions}
                  to avoid aliasing of data that, though legal, should
                  not be provided as input.}

  abstract  = { It is well known that performing test case generation
                  by symbolic execution on large programs becomes
                  quickly impracticable due to the path explosion
                  phenomenon.  This issue is considered a major
                  challenge in the software testing arena.  Another
                  common limitation in the field is that test case
                  generation by symbolic execution tends to produce an
                  unnecessarily large number of test cases even for
                  medium size programs.  In this paper we propose a
                  constraint logic programming approach to devise a
                  generic framework to guide symbolic execution and
                  thus test case generation.  We show how the
                  framework can help alleviate these scalability
                  drawbacks that most symbolic execution-based test
                  generation approaches endure.},
