PET is a research prototype which aims at automatically generating
test cases from Java bytecode programs by relying on the technique of
partial evaluation. The system receives as input a bytecode program
and a set of optional parameters, including a description of a
<em>coverage criterion</em>; and yields as output a set of test cases
which guarantee that the selected coverage criterion is achieved and,
optionally, a <em>test case generator</em>.
<br>
<br>
The test case generation process consists of two phases. (1) The
decompilation of bytecode into a Constraint Logic Program (CLP).  The
advantage of decompiling to CLP is that it handles most of the
required constraints for free. (2) The generation of test-case
generators from CLP decompiled bytecode. To carry out this phase, PET
integrates a CLP partial evaluator which is able to solve the
constraint system, in much the same way as a symbolic abstract machine
would do.  A unique feature of PET is that the test case generators it
produces are CLP programs whose execution in CLP returns further
test-cases on demand without the need to start the process from
scratch.  Another important feature of PET is that by using different
control strategies of the partial evaluator which can obtain different
degrees of coverage.
<br>
<br>
The PET web interface allows users to try out the system on a set of
representative examples, and also to upload their own bytecode
programs.
